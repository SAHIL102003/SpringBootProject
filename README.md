Backend: Java, Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA)
Frontend: ReactJS, Bootstrap
Database: MySQL
Machine Learning: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (if applicable)
Other Tools: Spring Tool Suite (STS), Git & GitHub, Postman (for API testing)

**Features:**
✔ User Authentication & Role-Based Access – Secure login system for different users
✔ Sentiment Classification – Categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
✔ Data Processing & Storage – Extracts, processes, and stores social media data in MySQL

✔ Error Handling & Logging – Robust error handling and logging with Spring Boot Actuator

**Project Workflow:**
Data Collection: Fetches social media posts (manually or via APIs)
Preprocessing: Cleans text by removing special characters, stop words, etc.
Sentiment Analysis: Uses text classification algorithms (Rule-based, ML, or AI-based models)
Storage: Stores analyzed data in MySQL
